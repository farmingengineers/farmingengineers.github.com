We accepted an offer on our house this weekend. It's a relief, but also stressful because now we HAVE to find a new place.

We'll be looking at farms on Thursday.  We have categorized the listings available right now by location and will be looking at them in some order approximating nearest to furthest.  Naturally we can get more land if we live farther away.  After all we've done to our current house we feel prepared to do some serious renovating if needed.
