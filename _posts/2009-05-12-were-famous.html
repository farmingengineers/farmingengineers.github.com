Check out <a title="Sunflowers in my Kitchen" href="http://http://kitchensunflowers.blogspot.com/2009/05/meeting-our-food.html">this post on Sunflowers in my Kitchen</a>.  She was a great help in chicken processing this past weekend.  There are before &amp; after pictures, but don't worry, no gross ones.

Today it was just barely dry enough to hoe the garlic by hand.  1 - 2 inches more rain predicted for tomorrow night, and the market starts May 30th.  Eek!  We'll be there, with green garlic, maybe some peonies, a little lettuce &amp; mint, and I don't know what else.  I dug around for the peas today and as I feared found only rotten seed.  I will start looking around for some to buy for the CSA.  I love peas myself and would hate for my CSA members to not have any.

The conventional farmers around here are just as antsy as I am.  Today I saw a lime truck going through the field across the street, which is an extremely soggy piece of ground in weather like this.  Maybe this will be the last big rain before the ground dries out.

In other possibly bad news, I plugged in my used walk-in cooler for the first time this weekend and it didn't get cold.  I've contacted the individual who sold it to me.  I very much hope that they make good on the guarantee that it was in working order when I bought it.

In good news, we are working on putting up an electric fence.  I hope to get it done this week, and to get some cows!  I think we will get five of the ones we went to look at last week.  The person selling them kindly offered to deliver them.
