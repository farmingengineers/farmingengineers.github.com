Thank you to all of our customers this year.  Whether you visit us at the market, join the CSA, or enjoy our real eggs, you keep us going.  You're the best.  Thank you for caring about where your food comes from.  Whenever we get to know you, we feel like we're meeting old friends.

We won't be at Traders Point market on Saturday, November 26th.  It will be our first completely market-free weekend since April!  We'll be back during the next two weekends for Christmas at the Market.

This is our time of year for planning &amp; analysis.  We'll keep you posted on any changes we're planning for 2011.

We got the Carmel market contract in the mail &amp; noticed a few changes:
<ul>
	<li>More market weeks:  The market will start May 21st and go through October 29th.  More work for us, but also more revenue.  Having another market for fall items will be nice.</li>
	<li>We're not enormous fans of the Carmel market's "50% rule," which is that 50% of product is supposed to be grown by the vendor.  As a grower, I'd rather have a grower-only market (a 100% rule, if you will) or at least more of an 80% rule.  However, a big step in the right direction is in the current contract.  Any products that vendors don't grow themselves are now supposed to be labeled with the name &amp; address of the grower.   I don't know how enforcement will work, but it sure seems like the right thing to do.  I think the market committee is concerned that a grower-only market would result in an insufficient product mix.  It will be interesting to see exactly which products are being "bought in."</li>
	<li>New market space.  The Carmel market is moving to the green next to the Palladium.  A new, larger, fabulously landscaped space with more parking is something both customers and vendors like us can be thankful for.</li>
</ul>
We are also very thankful for the friends &amp; family members who helped out on the farm this year.  Some worked for money, some were part of work shares, and some just volunteered their time and effort in various ways.  All of you are amazing.

Finally, we're just thankful that we get to do this.  Living in the country, seeing the stars, watching plants &amp; animals grow out of the soil, and watching the soil come back to life are everyday miracles.

Whenever someone asks me at the market, "Did you grow all of this yourself?"  I feel a strange moment of hubris when responding, "Yes."  Because I didn't, really.  The plants grew, but I'm not the one who told a tiny seed to open, instructed leaves to transform sun into energy, enabled roots to draw nutrients up from the soil, and made all prosper with flowers and fruits into something good to eat.  The plant grew itself, and whatever you believe about how it got the means to do that, I get to watch it happen all the time, over and over, thousands of times every season.  And that's what I'm most thankful for, and that's why I'm farming.
