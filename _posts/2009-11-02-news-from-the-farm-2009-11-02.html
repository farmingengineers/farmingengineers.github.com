Hello, friends!

Hard to believe it's November already. Our garlic's planted and we're still putting the garden to bed. The cattle are putting on their shaggy winter coats and we're cleaning out the barn.

From now until February, we have the following items available. Delivery/ Pickup in Noblesville/Carmel is every other Monday evening, and I can do special deliveries for large orders. Call or email with your order at least a few days in advance of when you need it.

Eggs $3.50 per dozen
Homemade bread $2.50 per loaf, white or wheat
Homemade fettucine $5 per 8 oz package. White or wheat, egg, spinach, or garlic
Banana bread 5$ per loaf. Add 75 cents each for nuts and/or chocolate chips
Pumpkin bread 5$ per loaf, with or without cream cheese icing Gingerbread cookies &amp; jam thumbprint cookies starting Nov. 21

We'll be at the Carmel Holiday Farmers Market on November 21st from 4:30 to 6:30 PM with all of these items. This market coincides with Santa, live reindeer petting zoo, tree lighting, and various other downtown Carmel festivities, so it's a not-to-be-missed event. The vendors will be located around the fountain, on Veterans Way, instead of in the City Hall parking lot as we are during the summer, and I'm told there will be plenty of ready-to-eat goodies &amp; hot drinks for sale.

CSA applications! This is a reminder that I would like CSA applications within the next week or two if you want to be assured of a spot. Join us for 16 weeks of produce in summer 2010. Some of you have verbally told me that you intend to participate next year, but my memory's not perfect, so I need the piece of paper too!

If I already have your application, you'll be notified of acceptance by December 1st, and deposits are due January 1. If you would like an application, or if you just want to know more about the CSA, send an email or call 317 362 6512. We'll have more applications available at the market on November 21st. After December 1st, applications are accepted on a rolling basis until we've got as many members as we think we can handle for the season. Pickups this year will be in Carmel, Noblesville, on the farm, and we may add a fourth location closer to Indianapolis if the demand exists.

Thanks again for being part of our season in 2009!

Lisa
