Trying to locate organic seed for a pasture is a bit of a challenge.  Availability is spotty, so I'll probably have to blend my own mix from what I can find.

I found a high-omega-3 chicken pasture mix, which sounds pretty good.  Mr. B. would probably like that for his chickens.  It's not organic, though.  I did find organic flax seed and buckwheat, which are major ingredients.
