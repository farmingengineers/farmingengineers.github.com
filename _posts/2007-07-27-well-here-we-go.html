Last night I said, "As soon as your parents sell their house, I'm ready to put ours on the market."

Mr. B.  seemed a bit taken aback, but not completely surprised.  We've been driving around looking at farms for sale for some time now, and it seems like we've been planning to move "within a year" for a while now as well.  The softening housing market right now doesn't make this a great time to sell, but we've sure seen a lot of farms for sale lately that look like they are worth closer investigation.

Getting this place ready to sell will take some work.  The garden is large and due to Baby B. is not in perfect order right now.  The house is 100+ years old, and while we've already done many things to improve it, we'd probably like to do a few more.

Of course, the "large" garden is relative.  Once we take the plunge and move to a farm, this one will seem small.  I'm excited about that.
