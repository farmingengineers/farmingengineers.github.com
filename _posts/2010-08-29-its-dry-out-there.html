I looked at our rain data for this summer and it was as follows:

June: 12.4 inches of rain

July : 7.9 inches of rain

August: 1.4 inches of rain

The rain in August has all come 1/4 inch at a time or so.  Right now I'm running the irrigation for a couple of days to loosen up the sweet potato hill.

Despite the dry conditions, and due to the drip irrigation, we have lots of fall stuff up and looking ok so far.  But it would all really take off if we had a nice, gentle, overnight rain.  It's funny how in June we can be praying for the rain to stop, and in August, wishing just a little of it would come back our way.
