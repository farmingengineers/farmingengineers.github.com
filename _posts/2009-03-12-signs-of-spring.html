Last week I saw my first grain truck.  This week, the crocuses are in bloom.  And best of all, we have seedlings out in the seed starting greenhouse.

Onions and cabbage are up,  broccoli and a few greens are next.  I'm building a raised bed for the greenhouse and am going to try putting a few tomatoes in there.  This is the first year I've used soil blocks.  So far, so good, except that I made the mix too wet and they take a good bit of extra squeezing to get the water out of them.  "Mud blocks" is more like it.

70 new chicks will be arriving in a few weeks, and so we're scrambling to get their housing ready.  Last year's layers seem positively geriatric by now, but they are starting to lay a bit better again now that the days are lengthening.  We're still talking about beef cows as another form of revenue and as an excellent addition to our fertility program.  So far it's just talk...
