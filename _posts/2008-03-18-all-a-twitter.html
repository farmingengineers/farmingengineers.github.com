The dog discovered the chicks this weekend. No, she didn't eat any (so far), but one of her new favorite places to hang out is just outside the door to their room. Every once in a while, she whines a little.

So, on Sunday, Mrs. B and I were sitting in the living room while the baby slept. We both heard, but didn't really notice, the dog whining a little more than usual.

Later, we went to the kitchen for a snack, and noticed that the chicks were quite a bit louder than usual. Strange. Well, we both thought it'd be a good idea to check in on them -- it had been a couple hours -- so I snuck past the dog into the bonus room

From across the room, I could see that the chicks were all running around their little area, and there was lots of loud chirping. When I got closer, I could see that the loudest one was pinned under the water bottle... they had knocked it over, and one was stuck! I rescued it, it joined its friends in the opposite corner, and things settled down in chicken-land.

Silly chickens.
