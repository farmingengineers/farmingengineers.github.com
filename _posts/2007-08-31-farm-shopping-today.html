Looked at 5 farms with the agent today.

Farm # 1:  Promising, but the lock box was not on the house, so we couldn't get in. (The house looked like it needed some work from the outside.)  30 acres, 16 tillable, 14 woods with a creek going through it.  There is an old barn and there were about half a dozen pigs living there.  And 2 dogs.  And at least 2 cats.

Farm #2:  Only 4 acres were cleared and the rest of the 12 was impenetrable thicket.  The house was ok.  4 tillable acres is not.

Farm #3: Former dairy farm with 11 acres.  The house was pretty nice, an older farm house.  The humongous dairy barns were taking up a lot of the land and it was way more barn than I could ever imagine needing.

Farm #4:  38 acres of land with a 1903 farmhouse.  High ceilings, wraparound porch, inside the house was in good shape.  It has an old barn which is fairly tired, a new pole barn (just finished in August), and a really new detached garage that will fit three cars at least.  I really liked this one.

Farm # 5:  11 acre horse farm.  Pretty nice old farmhouse with some weird aspects (like no doors anywhere inside.. not even on the bathrooms?)  with a newer horse barn &amp; big pasture.

We'll go farm shopping again next week.  Stay tuned.
