Thursday, we tilled the garden to mix in the mushroom compost that we spread last weekend.

Today, with the help of my parents, we got the garlic in the ground. We planted 5 lb french red shallots, 10 lb music, 5 lb CA late, and 2 lb German. As you can see, we didn't quite use up all of the garden, so the buyers should have plenty of space.
