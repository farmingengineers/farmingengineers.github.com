We got word on Friday that we'll be at the Carmel Farmer's Market next Saturday.  I could have gone this weekend, but we were busy &amp; I didn't have all the garlic cleaned up yet.

As soon as I heard the news, I went out and harvested all the onions.  They look pretty good.  They really weighed down the wagon.

I'll be busy cleaning garlic, shallots, onions, and trying to figure out if we have enough display containers for our booth this week.
