Like all engineers, we enjoy gadgets.

Yesterday I got gadget # 1, a wheel hoe.  Put it together and took it for a spin.  It's pretty nice.  Maybe I'll post a picture of it later.  It should be a lot easier on my back.

Later this week we're expecting a legal-for-commerce scale.  Electronic fun!
