One of our long-time friends, when first visiting our current house, remarked, "It has a ScaryCellar!"  Yes, just like the one Dorothy is trying to enter in "The Wizard of Oz."  Complete with disreputable doors and tiny, uneven steps.  Inside, there's nothing more interesting than a pressure tank and the whole-house water filter.

I wouldn't mind if our farm came with a ScaryCellar.  Maybe we could even use it for something, depending on the specifics of its condition.  The current ScaryCellar has too much heat pump ductwork to actually maintain ground temperature.
