Hi everyone,

We won't be at the Carmel market on Saturday. Instead, we'll be catching up on things around the farm, even if it's raining! We'll still be at Trader's Point on Friday night.

Our fall stuff is still hanging in there.. and still needs rain. Maybe Saturday!

If you're looking for something to do Monday night, September 13th, come out to Trader's Point Creamery and support the Kelly Funk recovery fund at the "Greens for Kelly" dinner. On the menu will be artisan breads and cheeses, summer sausages, an array of creative salads, desserts from some of Indy’s best bakeries and a selection of beers, meads and wines. A cash bar will also be offered for those wishing to purchase extra drinks or desserts.

Tickets are $25 each, or $100 for a family of 5. Dinner will be served in both barns from 5-9 PM, with live entertainment in the Red Barn, an opportunity to bid on silent auction items and a chance to tour the farm.

Tickets are pre-sale only, and may be purchased at the Valentine Hill Farm booth at the Trader’s Point Creamery, Broad Ripple, Binford, Zionsville and City Market farmers markets, or e-mail Maria (maria@valentinehillfarm.com) to get tickets by mail.
