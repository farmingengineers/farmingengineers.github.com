The scale came... while I was outside picking green beans.  So we had to go to the UPS depot at 7 PM to get it.  But at least we got it.

Market day was very successful. I sold all the garlic by 10:30 AM.  The red shallots sold out around the same time.  There was not much interest at all in the grey shallots.  I might not grow them again if I can't manage to get them to size up better.  However, right now I have plenty to replant in the fall and eat all winter, so maybe we'll try them for one more year.

We sold a good number of onions as well.  Next time I might cut the tops off, but I didn't want to do that this time because they weren't done curing.  We have plenty left for canning.

No one seemed overly excited about the onion braids.  They did, however, add a nice decorative touch to the booth.

Speaking of the booth... take <a href="http://www.68k.org:15751/photos/d/5935-1/p8040001.JPG">a look</a> at it.
