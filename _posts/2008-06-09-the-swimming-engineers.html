Our area has been deluged with rain lately.  The neighbors recorded 5 inches on Saturday alone.  The field is attempting to recover from lake status.  More rain is predicted tonight; I only hope it's not another 5 inches.  I didn't enjoy seeing my drip tape floating on top of water.  There is a flash flood watch for at least half the state tonight.

The farmer's market on Saturday was a bit of a washout, since that was the day we were getting the five inches of rain.  They tell me it doesn't happen too often, and we will have plenty of garlic scapes for weeks to come.  I pulled 539 of them on Friday.
