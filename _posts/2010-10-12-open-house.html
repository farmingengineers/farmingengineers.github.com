Our beef went to the processor yesterday.  It went pretty smoothly, didn't take long to get them in the trailer.

We're going to be looking for a few more calves over the next few months.  It's nice to take a break, and it's nice to work.

I'm working hard on getting ready for our open house this weekend.  It's going to be too warm for garlic planting, but there are plenty of other projects if you just have to get your hands dirty.  Work isn't required, though- there will be food, there's lots of room to walk around, the chickens will be doing all of their chicken things, and we have acres of nice flat ground for flying kites.  The corn was harvested on Friday, so you can run for a long way without going out of sight!
