After a long, crazy weekend, we have arrived on the farm.  We had great helpers and things went as smoothly as I could have hoped for.

I have a long list of winter projects to start outdoors once the house is unpacked.   Hopefully we'll have a nice vegetable patch ready in the backyard by spring.  There's a nice little 2.5 acre field that I'd like to start doing something with by then as well, but it may depend on the weather.  If it's a long, cold winter, I might not get outdoors enough.  I don't mind working in the cold, but I have to keep the baby warm when I'm out there as well, and that's a bit more challenging given his current aversion to hats.
