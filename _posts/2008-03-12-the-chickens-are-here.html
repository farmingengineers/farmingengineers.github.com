<p>A couple weeks ago, I ordered some chickens. This weekend, we set up the chick area.</p>

<p>This morning, the post office called at 6AM to say that the chickens were there. I went and got them, and they&#8217;re running around their little pen.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got 5 araucanas, 10 silver-laced wyandottes, and 10 barred plymouth rocks. We're hoping to get about 10-15 layers, and the rest will be for meat.</p>
