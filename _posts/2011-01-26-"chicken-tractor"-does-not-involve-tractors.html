We are about to embark on our fourth year of raising chickens. In our first three years, we've tried a few different styles of housing (we're currently using the sixth), and each time it feels a little more like we know what we're doing.

Before I talk about the houses we've tried, I should start with our goals for raising chickens. The first goal is to raise them outside. We want them to eat green stuff. This helps them l<a title="Why grass?" href="http://burkefarm.wordpress.com/why-grass/">oad up their meat and eggs with more omega-3s</a>, and it cuts down a little on feed costs. We also want them to rotationally graze with the cattle so they can tear up cow pies, so the cow pies get aerated and de-grubbed. We also want to spread the chicken manure around so that the entire property gets some fertility from them and so that no one spot gets so much chicken-love that it turns into a dirt patch. Finally, we need the chickens to have shelter from the elements and protection from predators.

So, their housing needs to be mobile. We also like having a movable fence that keeps chickens and eggs in and predators out.

As with many of our projects, the first try exposed our inexperience. It's usually not a totally unworkable approach, but it's always lacking.

Our first try at chicken housing was a small barn on short stilts made from reclaimed lumber. ("Reclaimed" means "lying behind the barn in the weeds and not too rotten to grab onto some nails.") When the chickens were small, we had a small pen pushed up next to the stilt barn so they could get out of the house for some sun and air, with a barrier between them and our not-a-farm-dog.

The pen was an old rabbit hutch that I had built in about 2002. When the chickens were larger, we put up a dog kennel around their house and moved the whole thing about every day or every other day. There were 25 straight-run chickens, and the kennel gave them about 64 sq ft. When the layers started laying, I set up a new, taller-stilted house with a door for getting eggs and wheels! to make it easier to move.

For the winter, we insulated the stilt barn with tekfoil. We rotationally grazed them still (though I'm not sure they got much out of seeing new snow every other day). We eventually moved them closer to the house and gave them a large area with a chicken wire perimeter fence. In the last couple of months that we had them, they were free-range.

We learned a couple lessons from this. One lesson was that houses without wheels are a pain to move. Another was that chickens lay better if they have good nests. The last was that we don't like shoveling manure out of their house.

<strong>Flock 2</strong>

The second year we had chickens, we built two houses.

For the layers, we built a house with an open floor, wood sides, and a metal roof. Three of the walls folded down to make nice, big windows. The fourth wall opened like french doors so we could collect eggs.

For the broilers, we built a 7x7 Salatin-esque broiler house. I also built two dollies for moving the houses. The dollies were made from 2x4s and some lawn mower wheels from Menards.

Both of the houses used reclaimed materials.

One thing I liked (initially) about the layer house was that we could get the chicks on grass without requiring a fence: put down the sides for light and air, and let them pick at the grass.

The main disadvantage of the house was its weight: moving it was something that we could barely do together. It involved using a lever to pick it up and dollies to glide it. On one of the moves, we ended up crushing two or three chicks.

For a little while, we used the dog kennel as a chicken run again. This flock was 50 layers, so the kennel was really too small. While we had the kennel set up, the <a href="http://burkefarm.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/chicken-rescue-squad/">chicken rescue squad</a> made its appearance.

When we got the chickens into the pasture with the cows, we switched them to an electric bird net. This was more like 1500 sq ft, so there was plenty of space for everybody.

The lessons from this layer house were: too heavy, and an open floor is really nice.

The broiler house was just right.

<strong>Flock 3</strong>

Going into the third year, we needed to decide whether to make the houses more practical to move by a person, or to make them more practical to move by a tractor. Being able to move the houses by hand stresses the birds less (they don't like tractors driving through their area). But it seemed like it was going to be easier to figure out how to build a tractor-movable shelter than a human-movable shelter.

Over the winter before we got our third flock, we went to the MOSES conference. We picked up a book about chicken houses. Most of the houses were too small or too large, but a couple were just right. The one I liked the best was what we picked for their summer quarters: the chicken prairie schooner.

In the book, the chicken prairie schooner looks like a covered wagon with a nest box on the back. We built two of them at first: one with a nest on the back (for last year's layers) and one with no nest box.

The one with the nest ended up pretty heavy, but it was light enough that either of us could move it on our own.

The one without the nest box was really easy to move. In fact, it was so easy to move that the wind tossed it over the fence one day. And the chickens could tip it by all roosting next to the door. These problems were easy to correct with a cement block.

Here's what I think about the chicken prairie schooner. It's pretty easy and cheap to build: I can build one in about a day. For the ribs, 1" PVC works fine, but the higher psi PVC holds up better to bending. Putting chicken wire around the edges helps keep the birds in the house when you want them to be, but it makes it really difficult to fish out eggs that they occasionally lay in the middle of the house. Putting the nest box on the end forces the chickens to walk through the roosting area to go lay, so their feet ended up dirty and the eggs were generally dirtier.

For the flock that didn't have a schooner with a nest box, we built a separate nest house. This house was on skis (2x6s on end, with the corners cut off the bottom). It has a handle on one end for dragging. On the other end is a small door for the chickens to come in. The nests are on two levels. The nests are office supply boxes with no lid and an entry cut in one end. I stood the lids on end between the boxes to give the chickens some privacy and to discourage them from hopping from box to box.

I'm pleased with the nest house. It's a little heavy for moving, but once it gets going it isn't too bad.

The worst thing about their current housing is the orange fence: in order to keep the chickens inside it, I need to move it while it's dark outside. It takes 45 minutes or so to move, so in the middle of the summer I'm usually moving it from 9:30 till 10:30. The cows liked to complicate the fence move, too.

The broilers were in the same broiler house from last year. There were more of them, so we needed to move them twice a day. Also, we fell down on our duties and they got too wet and cold one night. So, next time we will be better about keeping them covered up overnight.

<strong>This winter</strong>

This winter, the chickens are living in "eggloos, "another idea from the chicken house book. These houses are made of hay bales in the form of an igloo. (The book says to use hay that got rained on, but there wasn't much rained-on hay around this year.)  The chickens have definitely stayed warmer than in past winters in their hay houses.  On zero degree days, we could feel the warm air blasting out from within them.  A few experiments with a thermometer have revealed that it's at least 40 F inside.  Our winter egg laying numbers have been far better, too.

<strong>Next year</strong>

Next year, I expect the layers to be in a schooner. 100 chicks or 50 layers per schooner is about right.

We're planning to raise more broilers next year, so we'll need to expand their housing. One option is to build more Salatin-style houses. Another is to build hoop houses and let them graze inside an orange electric fence, like what we have now.
