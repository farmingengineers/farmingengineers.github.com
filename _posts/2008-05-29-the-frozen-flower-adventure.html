I was pretty excited to have a bunch of peonies in the fridge to sell this weekend.  I went out this morning to check on them &amp; add some more to the bucket, and there was ICE on top of the water.

Oops.  It's a new-to-us refrigerator, and I guess the temperature was adjusted to overzealously-cold.

The peonies are thawing right now.  I hope they still look nice for Saturday!
