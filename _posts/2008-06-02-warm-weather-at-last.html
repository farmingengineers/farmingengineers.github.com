We had a beautiful day on Saturday for the market.  Peonies and pea shoots were popular.

Everything is now planted except for the sweet potatoes.  They should be done either Monday or Tuesday.  The warm weather means that the crabgrass is really taking off, so I'll be spending more quality time with the wheel hoe.  Only certain areas of the field are affected by the crabgrass plague.

When I harvested some green garlic on Thursday, it was clear that scapes were getting ready to pop.  I am looking forward to harvesting them this week.

We are doing research on a better way to handle our pea shoots this week.  They made it about halfway through the market day on Saturday, and I know we can do better.  So delicious, they are worth the trouble!
