Here are some thoughts about the 2011 growing season.

<strong>Chicken </strong>

We sing the praises of the cornish cross broiler chicken.. they don't like cold weather, they don't have any defenses against owls, and they don't do well when arriving from the hatchery infected with <em>psedomonas aeruginosa</em>, but they do like eating organic feed, eating grass and bugs, and fertilizing the pasture.  3 batches of broilers came through our farm this summer, and by the third batch, everything went right.  We will have our pastured, organically-fed chicken meat until it sells out.  How long will that be?  I can't say for sure, but as of today, we have a nice quantity.  We are still offering our $4.00/lb special on 5 or more whole birds.

Our laying chickens also had some encounters with weather and Mr. Owl, but we are happy to say that we have had our best egg year ever, and we added a fall batch of laying chicks to help offset the spring egg laying slump we have experienced in other years.

<strong>Produce</strong>

Our CSA surveys indicate that some of you noticed the improvement in what was going on around the farm, while others of you felt 2011 was about the same as other seasons.  From my perspective, things went better than ever before after the initial 30-days-late start caused by the greenhouse falling down.  The credit for this can be evenly split between K., our awesome farm employee, and Mr. B's new work-at-home job.

When we are sort-of-close to keeping up with the farm work, new and/or difficult crops don't go by the wayside.  So you got to try <strong>edamame</strong> this year, we had fall <strong>carrots</strong>, and for the first time there were actually three plantings of <strong>summer squash</strong> which all survived and came in like they were supposed to.  You can tell we weren't fully on top of things, though, by the absence of celeriac, parsley, and dill... these items made it into the field, but were casualties of an edge-of-the-field weed invasion.  Such is life. And the flower bouquets we've had at market in other summers?  Same weed problems.. but also, most of the cutting flowers didn't make it into the field because we ran out of room!

Despite a general trend for lower farmer's market sales as more markets appear all over town, we had our best season ever.  Offering more products and a fuller table is working out for us.  I don't believe we need to add a third market (thank goodness).

<strong>The future </strong>

Everyone has asked when we're getting more cattle.  We have contracted with an excavator to clear our old fence row this fall.  Our hope is to get 15 acres of new fence put up in early spring. If the fence is up and we've sold enough CSA shares by April, it will be time for cattle then.

I am currently trying to plow up another area for expanded vegetable production.  If it is ready in time for 2012, this will be cultivated repeatedly, I will hill up raised beds, and it will be used as a squash and/or bean field so that we can see how the heavy June rains lie in it before using it in early spring.   Squash is a space hog and it will be nice to get it into its own field.  Having a larger production area means we can expand the CSA or grow more of a few items like onions which we always have demand for.
