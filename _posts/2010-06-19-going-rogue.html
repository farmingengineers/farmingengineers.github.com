One of our Araucana hens has "gone rogue."  She avoids the rest of the flock, and sleeps by herself on the top shelf of a shelving unit on our porch instead of in the house with the other chickens.

The weather is a bit rogue, too.  We got another inch of rain last night, and the ground was still quite wet from the 2.5 inches on Monday.  30 - 40 % chances of storms all week don't sound too terrible, except that COULD mean "rain every day," which would be quite an unwelcome boost for the weed population.  Stay tuned!
