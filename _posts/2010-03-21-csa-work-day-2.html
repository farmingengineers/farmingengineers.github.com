We had much nicer weather for yesterday's CSA work share day.  Two members came out and we worked on the hoophouse &amp; made soil block mix &amp; blocks.  If things had gone a little more smoothly, we'd probably have gotten the whole frame up, but some of the sleeves are stuck on the ground posts &amp; we were not able to remove all of them.  So we got 1/3 of the bows put up.  We may have to fabricate some larger sleeves.

If you live in Noblesville, Westfield, Carmel, Sheridan, or thereabouts, and are looking for a CSA where you have the opportunity to get more involved &amp; see what happens on a working vegetable farm, we have the one for you!  As one of our members said today when things were a little crazy during the project, "You can't make this stuff up!"  It's always an adventure around here.

We are looking in to having a couple on-farm events that are fun-centered throughout the summer.  U-Pick peas and a salsa fest are being considered.  We've also heard a lot of interest is out there for visiting our baby chicks when they arrive.
