Hello friends,

The rain has encouraged me to come indoors.  I have harvested in the rain before, but if it clears up later (which it's supposed to do) I'd rather be outside then.  We're getting anxious to plow up the field for October garlic planting, but there will be no plowing in the mud!

The chickens have laid lots of beautiful eggs for you this week, green &amp; brown.  

It's the last week of the season at the Carmel Farmers Market, other than a possible December holiday market.  If we do an October market in some other location, I'll email about it.  Most likely, we'd be selling eggs, baked goods, and next year's CSA shares.

CSA members: This is our 15th week, and next week is the 16th and final week.  A few of you are off by a week either way; I'll talk with you personally about when your shares end.  I hope you all have enjoyed participating in our first ever adventure as a CSA farm.  

As we plan for next season, your feedback is extremely helpful.  I keep track of your comments and thoughts throughout the year.  You'll be getting another email soon with a link to a web survey.  If you can fill this out, it will really help us.  Thanks!

At the market:

Tomatoes
Eggs
Peppers, including red ones
Wax beans
Tomatillos
Flowers
Last of the pears

In addition to those things, the following items may appear in CSA shares:

Lettuce
Chard, Kale, Collards
Green onions

If it stops raining today:

Sweet potatoes
Red potatoes
Okra
Purple beans
Parsley, parsley, and more parsley
