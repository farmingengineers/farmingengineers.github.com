We can now add spring chickens to <a href="http://burkefarm.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/signs-of-spring/">our list of the signs of spring</a>. We have 70 chicks under a heat lamp now. That's up from 25 last year. There's one breed that's the same, and a couple that are different.

Some things that I've noticed this year:

Seventy chicks in a box are noisier than twenty-five chicks in a box. The ride home from the post office was ... chirpier.

Seventy chicks are a lot crazier, when they're out of the box. It's kind of like kids... when there's one or two, they're usually pretty calm. But the more kids you put in the same room, the louder and crazier they get. The chicks moved around a lot more. They seemed to have fun running up the hills that lead to their water.

It's a bit amusing to watch seventy chicks all stand up straight and turn their heads at the exact same instant when your toddler drops a loud something in the other corner of the room.

This morning, it was peaceful and calm watching the chicks all cuddled up with each other, sleeping. I'm glad their party wound down eventually last night, and they got some rest.
