So far, our only commercial crops have been garlic &amp; shallots.  Last year we harvested about 400 garlic bulbs &amp; about 8 lbs of shallots (if I remember right.)  Most of it sold in 2 Saturday mornings at the farmer's market.

This year,  we had 2 large problems with the garlic.  First, I ordered the seed too late and we obviously got the dregs from the grower.  Second, we had a weather issue.  The winter was excessively warm and all the garlic came up optimistically in January.  Then we had a hard freeze.  This happened twice I think.  So we lost a lot of our garlic that way.  It didn't seem to faze the shallots too much, though.

So this year, we have only 180 heads of garlic, despite planting twice as much as before.   We grew 2 types of shallots, and one type yielded 7.5 lbs.  I haven't weighed the other kind yet.

We haven't solidified our plans for selling it yet.  I'll post again when we know where we'll be selling this year.  I believe we'll also be bringing onions to the farmer's market- there are more than enough in the field for our home needs, even with all the canning we do.
