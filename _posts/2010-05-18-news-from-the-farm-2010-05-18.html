Hello friends,

Market News

Carmel farmers market starts May 22nd. So Saturday is a great day to come out &amp; see us there.

We're also doing the Traders Point market on Friday nights from 4 to 8. It's our first year at this market &amp; we're enjoying it so far.

On the Farm

We attended the MOSES organic farming conference at the end of February, and are still sorting through all the great ideas &amp; information we learned. It was quite exciting to meet and learn from other organic farmers in the midwest who are doing what we're doing, and to gain more ideas for success.

Things look great in the field- we're presently ahead of the weeds. The garlic is beautiful, and several other vegetables are out there. Our greenhouse tomatoes are just starting to make small green fruit. We'll be putting out field tomatoes within the next week or two. We've got a lot of squash, melons, and other cucurbits ready to be transplanted outside in addition to the 60 or so plants already in the field under a row cover.

We have hired an intern, who is starting his trial period with us this week. I'll tell you more about this soon.

Chicken news: We have 100 new pullets out in the cow pasture, enjoying life in their moveable chicken house. Our first batch of meat birds will be ready in a couple of weeks- if you are interested in one, please make a reservation now. We'll be selling whole birds only.

Upcoming Farm Events

We want to make this YOUR farm &amp; create more opportunities for you to see what's happening throughout the season, whether you are just a casual farmer's market customer or a working CSA member. We're planning to host a pea-picking event around the end of June, a salsa-making event later in August, and possibly another
canning-related event this summer. More details will be forthcoming.
