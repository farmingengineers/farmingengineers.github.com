Hi friends,

The fall stuff is going in where the garlic and potatoes came out. I was working up the area this week with a disk, and managed to pre-slice a number of potatoes that didn't get harvested. Some of the potatoes managed not to get pre-sliced, giving me hope for using a mechanical potato harvester some time in the future.

Anyway, Grandma watched Oliver yesterday, so the fall planting is now well underway. I hoed the radishes, lettuce, carrots, and beets that were put in a few weeks ago, then put in 6 rows of drip tape and planted about 12 flats of seedlings, which included purple beans, radishes, beets, turnips, chard, and kale. More transplanting and direct seeding will happen on Saturday afternoon and/or Sunday- I plan to get the broccoli and cabbage planted, and start some additional lettuce, arugula, and other greens mix.

Matt took today off to build emergency chicken housing. Our 100 pullets have been living in a house designed for 50, waiting for the second 50-chicken house to get completed. This was okay when they were all tiny baby chicks, but now they are starting to get close to adult size. Last night the house decided it'd had enough and collapsed. The good news is that these same pullets started laying eggs this week, and their egg-laying skid house is fine. In the next 3 to 4 weeks you'll start seeing pullet eggs at the Carmel market, and information at both markets about winter egg shares. The eggs are all organic feed, free range, and their house is moved to new grass daily during grass season... when it's in one piece, that is.

This weekend at the markets, things may look a little sparse. Don't worry, they'll pick up again soon.

Markets:

Tomatoes
Basil
Cucumbers
Husk Cherry
Flowers (Friday only)
Possibility of okra
Possibility of red raspberries from another farm- just don't know if we will get out to pick them this week. (Saturday only)

CSA boxes:

Apples, from our tree!
Basil
Tomatoes
Potatoes
Kale
Wax beans
Some boxes: okra, husk cherry, spaghetti squash
