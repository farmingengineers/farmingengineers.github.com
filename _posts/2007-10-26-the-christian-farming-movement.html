I didn't know there was such a thing, until a friend <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/october/43.64.html">forwarded me this article.</a>

I had noticed some individuals at markets who look like stereotypical Christian Homeschoolers, but around here I wouldn't say they make up 80% of the consumer base.  But maybe I'm unfairly stereotyping.

Anyway, I think it's a neat trend.  I don't usually like trends, but this is one that I am glad we'll be a part of.
