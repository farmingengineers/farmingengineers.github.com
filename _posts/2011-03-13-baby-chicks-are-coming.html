Baby chicks are coming this week.  Today we finished working on the brooder.  It's amazing how much junk can be stored in one tiny little building.  

Some finds:

- A car jack
- 1/2 bag charcoal from 1990
- A calf pan (galvanized tub with attached calf nipple)
- 150 or so canning jars
- 150 or so mayonnaise jars 
- Five large coffee cans almost full of roofing nails
- Window weights
- Many rusty gardening tools

We'll probably use the window weights as canopy weights for our market canopy.  As for the roofing nails- I guess we're prepared to re-shingle the roof! 

Tomato plants have germinated for the new hoophouse.  Now that the brooder is ready, hopefully we can make some progress on putting up the new hoophouse.
