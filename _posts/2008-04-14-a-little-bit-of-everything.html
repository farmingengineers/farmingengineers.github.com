The weather is starting to look up a little, at least if I look at the 5-day forecast.  This morning I ran across Ecclesiastes 11:6-

"Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well."

This year, our philosophy is to grow some of everything, and see what does the best/ makes the most money, or at least what has a good profit-to-labor ratio.  And it's very true that I am growing many, many new-to-me crops, and I do NOT know which will succeed.. the weather, the conditions, and the crops themselves are all variables.  It's exciting to watch, though.  If "both will do equally well" we will be so, so busy!
