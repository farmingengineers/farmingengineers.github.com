Hi everyone,

We've got eggs. Egg share &amp; 2011 CSA applications are now available. Current members will get them in their boxes before the end of the season- everyone else can find them on our web site:
burkefarm.wordpress.com

Briefly, eggs can be delivered to your house, 4 dozen minimum, October through May. For 2011, we're adding a 4-week spring greens option to the CSA, as well as the option to add broiler chickens. The best news of all: the 16 week vegetable shares will not increase in price for 2011.

Spent today digging sweet potatoes and tearing tomato vines out of the hoop house. I've been running the irrigation a lot, but we could use some real, out-of-the-sky, rain.

Both markets:
Apples
Quart boxes of green tomatoes, for frying
CSA &amp; egg share info

Trader's point:

Flowers
Basil
Long beans?
Red &amp; green okra

Carmel:

Eggs!
Anything that some Friday night vendor has left over...

See you soon,

The Burkes
