Yesterday was decidedly spring-like, so I got out to do some spring cleaning in the old barn. The stated goal was to scoop out the poop that was in the loft. Once I had my cleaning goggles on, though, I found plenty of stuff to clean up. Being an old barn, I found lots of <span style="text-decoration:line-through;" title="not really">interesting</span> stuff.
<ul>
	<li>A tent. It may be fine. It looked like it just had a hole in the bag.</li>
	<li>A mess kit. It didn't look very rusty on the outside.</li>
	<li>A paper cup from Noble Romans. It had degraded to something much more like a cloth cup.</li>
	<li>A roll of tar paper, like for roofing.</li>
	<li>A pile of white powder that I think is cement mix.</li>
	<li>A wedge, like for splitting wood.</li>
	<li>A bunch of random pieces of metal. Some were 1/8" or 1/4" thick, and looked like they'd come off of a tractor. One was the metal part of some hand cultivator. There was metal mesh, metal wire.</li>
	<li>Doors. Lots of doors. Screen doors. Interior doors. Exterior doors.</li>
	<li>A bathroom vanity.</li>
	<li>An (apparently) unused (and never fully assembled, and still in its original box) shop light.</li>
	<li>Scraps of lumber, including fragments of landscaping timbers, a pallet, an old livestock crate, some support beams, a shelf (still with brackets).</li>
	<li>A fireplace broom. It matches a poker I'd found back when we moved in. I almost have a complete set now!</li>
	<li>A used 4-cylinder head gasket.</li>
	<li>A 9 inch section of gutter, with an S-shaped piece of downspout.</li>
	<li>A weird ceramic thing. Someday, there will be pictures, if we don't throw it out first.</li>
	<li>An ugly old lawn chair. The kind with a metal frame and a plastic weave.</li>
	<li>A pad for a chair. I think. It was shaped like and about the size of something you'd put between yourself and a chair. But it also resembled a sock in that it had two layers, and an opening where it stopped going up the back of the chair.</li>
	<li>A pad for a deck chair.</li>
	<li>A hand tool, or a portion thereof. It has a wood handle, and some metal stuff on one end. It looks like there's a spring in there. And there's a piece of twine wrapped around it. Was it a flail? Was it a baler?</li>
	<li>A lever, like for opening the trunk of the car from the front seat, with the cable attached.</li>
	<li>A metal funnel.</li>
	<li>An tub for catching automotive oil.</li>
	<li>An empty antifreeze bottle and an empty windshield washer bottle.</li>
	<li>Lots of pieces of rubber tubing, some small, some large.</li>
	<li>A 10 foot piece of 2" or 3" PVC pipe.</li>
	<li>A bunch of twine tied to one of the rafters.</li>
	<li>A large plastic barrel.</li>
	<li>Some large plastic paint buckets.</li>
	<li>An empty cool-whip container.</li>
</ul>
