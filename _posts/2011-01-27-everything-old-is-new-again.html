We got in touch with the folks at vintageaerial.com  this week and looked at some historic photos of our farm.  While I haven't shelled out $350 for a print yet, it was very interesting to see that, in 1973, the south lawn of our property was a one-acre vegetable garden.

This is approximately where we are currently growing strawberries, have put up a hoophouse, and are about to put up a second hoophouse.  37 years later, it's nice to know that we have the same agrarian, back-to-the-land ideas as whoever lived here in the past!
