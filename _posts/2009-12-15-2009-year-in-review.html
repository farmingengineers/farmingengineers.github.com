Memories of 2009:

A long, rainy spring.  Frantically throwing everything into the field at the end of May.

Escaping cattle.

Hundreds of lbs. of tomatoes.  Haven't added up the total yet, but it was close to half a ton.

Chickens in the mulch.

Best bell peppers ever, thanks to plastic mulch.

Not a very good squash year- it was wanting some hot weather, and probably more bees.

Beans! Beans! Beans!  Three months of constant beans!  So many that I gave up on picking them.
