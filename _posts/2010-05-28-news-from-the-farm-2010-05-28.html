Hi everyone,

Everything is growing like crazy in the heat.. including weeds!

I am seeing the start of a few broccoli heads, which makes me glad that the weather has cooled off again. Our peas are flowering-- stay tuned for the u-pick peas date to be announced soon. Sour cherries are covering the tree and are right on the brink of being ripe. Sold all our early ones within 5 minutes at TPC farmer's market this week..

Our laying chickens are all upset with us this week- we moved them to a new house. They are rewarding us for doing this by laying eggs on the floor of the coop, in the woods, and in fencerows. So we'll be a little short on eggs until they get the hang of their new digs. We still seem to have 43 laying hens despite the presence of a mother fox and 3 babies in our front yard!

We're processing chicken next week. Place your orders now if you want it fresh. If we raise another batch, it won't be ready until August. Whole birds only, priced around 3 to 4 dollars per lb. Birds will probably be in the 3 to 4 lb range but we haven't weighed any yet.

This week at the market:

Chard
Lettuce mix
Greens mix - last week for a while
Garlic scapes
Radishes
Peonies
Cilantro
Tomato plants - Carmel only

Next week:

Pie cherries (maybe TPC only)
Snow peas and snap peas

Also soon:
Dark Green Zucchini
Broccoli
