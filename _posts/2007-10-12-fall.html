We're eating lots of lettuce and enormous radishes from the fall garden.  The greens have been pretty much obliterated by cabbage worms, and the carrots and beets are just now sizing up.  I picked one last half-bushel of tomatoes this week.  There are still a myriad of peppers to harvest.  Low temps are in the 40s now and so there's not much garden time left.

I've been clearing out space for this fall's load of mushroom compost, and then we can plant the garlic &amp; shallots.  The seed garlic looks really good this year, the shallots not so much.  I want to get them in the ground soon before they rot any more.
