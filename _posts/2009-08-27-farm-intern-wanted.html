We have decided to seek a farm intern for the 2010 growing season.  Our farm is located in central Indiana.  We offer room, board, a monthly stipend, and a small but growing library of interesting books on sustainable farming topics.This intern will receive hands-on learning experience with all phases of organic vegetable production for market and CSA customers.  We raise our own transplants and plan to add some tunnel production in 2010. We'll be entering our third year of transitioning to organic while growing our customer base.

The ideal person would also be handy with tools, building stuff, fencing, and tractors, but that's not a requirement.  The main requirements are an interest in organic farming and the desire to work hard for 5 and half days per week.  Email us or comment on this post for additional information!
