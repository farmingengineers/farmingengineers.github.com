Product List

Hi friends!

You'd think that things would be slowing down for us, now that it's almost October, the CSA is almost over, and there's still no rain on the horizon. We're still pretty busy, though, especially this weekend.

It's our last Saturday for the season at Carmel. The Trader's Point market continues through the end of October on Friday evenings.

We'll be at Trader's Point from 11 AM to 5 PM on SUNDAY for Oktoberfest. It's a gated-admission event, Polka Boy will provide music, there will be beer, hayrides, a pumpkin patch, This Old Farm is providing a multitude of brats, and many of your favorite all-natural and organic Friday night market vendors will be there, selling all kinds of things. We'll be there with outrageous brownies (about 500 calories each- dieters beware!), chocolate-oatmeal bars, Matt's awesome cinnamon rolls, our great farm fresh eggs, and any produce we have the ambition to pull after Friday &amp; Saturday.

If you are still thinking about reserving some beef, we need to know by the end of this weekend. Thank you so much to all of you who have passed on our information to your family, friends, and coworkers- I've been pleasantly surprised!

CSA members, thank you again for bearing with us through a somewhat challenging growing season. Monday folks should have gotten an email survey today, and I'll send it out to Saturday folks soon after you receive your last box this weekend. We are already getting applications for next year and are accepting them on a first-come, first-served basis.

We're looking at starting the egg deliveries on either Monday, October 11th, or Monday, October 18th. If you currently or will soon receive eggs, feel free to express your opinion on this subject. If you haven't signed up yet, we still have eggs available throughout the winter.

At the markets- a little bit of many things:

Arugula
Basil
Radishes
Carrots!
Red apples
Husk Cherries
Long Beans
Red &amp; green okra
Dregs of the sweet potatoes
Eggs, except on Friday night
Flowers

See you soon,

Lisa &amp; Matt
