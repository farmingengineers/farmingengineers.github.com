We signed the contract and will be at the Carmel Farmers Market throughout the 2010 season.  The market starts on May 22nd and runs through October 2nd - a few weeks earlier and later than in past years.  We're still working on adding another market, and will keep you posted when that's determined.

We still have space in our 2010 CSA. 16 weeks of produce, mid-June through late September or early October.  <a href="http://burkefarm.wordpress.com/how-to-join-our-csa/">Applications are available here! </a>

Baby plants are now growing in our seed-starting house, and baby chicks are coming in less than a month.  It's almost spring!
