There are so many tomatoes right now that we aren't keeping ahead of them, canning only on the weekends.

Dug the first hill of Yukon Gold potatoes this week.  They look nice, but there just are not a whole ton of them with the weather we've had.  Potatoes like a lot of rain when they're trying to potato, and it has not rained much here this summer.  There is another partial hill of them to dig, so I won't post the yield until they are all out of the ground.

I'm looking forward to digging the "All Blue" potatoes a little later, when the vines have died down.   The description in the catalog said they were very abundant yielders, so we'll see what that means when it hardly rains at all.
