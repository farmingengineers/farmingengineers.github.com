I've been a little remiss in posting lately because all my free time is being spent picking berries!  Right now almost a gallon of blackberries per day come out of the hedgerow, with a little help from me.

The garlic sold like hotcakes last week.  I predict we have 4 - 6 weeks worth of garlic to sell this year, maybe less if sunnier market days give us higher sales.  This Saturday is supposed to be scorching hot, so I'm wondering how that affects the market turnout.
