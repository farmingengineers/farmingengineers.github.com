We have more hens laying more eggs than ever before.  Egg salad, deviled eggs, homemade ice cream and angel food cake, and scrambled eggs are being consumed by us in great quantities.  We personally eat the eggs that are not of high enough quality for our customers, and lately, we've been barely able to keep up!  Hens love increasing day length, so spring is always a great time for egg production.

We've also got lettuce from the hoophouse for another few weeks.  With our recent warm temperatures, outdoor planting is underway, and lettuce will be in the field soon.  We'll then have room for cucumbers, eggplant, and peppers in the greenhouse, along with the tomatoes, which are already planted.

Today's rain was perfectly timed- onion sets, peas, radishes, and salad turnips seeded this week in the field will now have a chance to start growing!
