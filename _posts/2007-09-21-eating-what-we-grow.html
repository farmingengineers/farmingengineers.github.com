Right now, at this very moment, the fall garden is coming into production.  This means we have the following vegetables available:
<ul>
	<li>Kale</li>
	<li>Mizuna</li>
	<li>Leaf lettuce (red and green)</li>
	<li>Tah tsai (an Asian green with cute round leaves)</li>
	<li>Radishes</li>
	<li>Green beans (still going from summer)</li>
	<li>Carrots (soon)</li>
	<li>Beets (soon)</li>
</ul>
The herb patch, with thyme, chives, sage, flat-leaf parsley, basil, and cilantro, is still going to town as well.

This week, I had a bunch of leftover goat leg meat that was kind of languishing in the fridge.  We'd eaten all the pitas, and hummus, and feta cheese, and so the goat meat was not inspiring us to eat it.  So I decided to make some meat bred.

I've only made meat bread about one other time, and it didn't turn out well.  It was with ground beef I think, and a lot of poppyseeds, and ended up really dry.

So here's what I did:  I took a recipe for herb and cheese bubble bread, in the red plaid cookbook that is ubiquitous across American kitchens.  I used Monterey jack cheese.  But I deviated from the recipe as follows:

1. It called for making the bread into balls, rolling the balls in butter + dry herbs, and sticking them in a bowl.  I used fresh herbs from the garden (everything except sage &amp; cilantro).

2. I stuffed the balls with a seasoned meat mixture instead of just making them plain old dough balls.  Here's the approximate recipe for my meat mixture:
<ul>
	<li>4 -6 oz meat, finely chopped</li>
	<li>5 leeks, chopped (they were on the small side)</li>
	<li>2 T minced fresh parsley</li>
	<li>4 T minced fresh chives</li>
	<li>2 T minced fresh basil</li>
	<li>2 T thyme leaves</li>
	<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
	<li>A bunch of fresh ground pepper</li>
	<li>A glug of lemon juice &amp; olive oil (the meat was on the dry side)</li>
</ul>
The goat meat stuffed bread came out really well, cooked just as the original recipe suggested.  The meat was flavorful &amp; moist again, the bread was yummy &amp; herbal.  I love it when an experiment comes out right.
