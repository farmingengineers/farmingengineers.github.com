In the last 2 days, 2 farmers have shown up at my doorstep wanting to rent the big chunk-o-land.  A third one is interested as well.

Should I engage in a bidding war, or pick the smallest farmer among the three?  Or see if any of them grow non-GMO?  Those are the three options I am considering.  Other suggestions are welcome.  I'll still be keeping plenty of the land un-rented for my use.
