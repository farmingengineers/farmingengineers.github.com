Open House &amp; Pea Picking!

Sunday, June 13th, 1:30 - 4:30 PM.

1 qt peas per family.  3$/ qt for peas, free for CSA members.

Next year I'll plant more so everyone can pick as much as they like!

Directions- I would have linked to google maps, but it has real trouble getting to our house.  You can try putting Hills Baptist Church, Kirklin, IN into your GPS, but this may result in excessive travel on gravel.

From Carmel:

Go north on 31.  Continue to SR 38.  Take 38 W toward Sheridan.

Continue on 38 through downtown Sheridan.  38 jogs left after the IGA grocery store, look for California Street and the Sheridan Airport sign.

Turn north (right) on California St / Jerkwater Rd.

Continue north past the airport until you reach a 4-way stop at 296th St/ County Rd 600 S/ County Line Rd.

Turn left (west) at the 4-way stop.

In about a mile, you'll reach 1400 E / 1200 W.  Go north (right) on 1400 E.  It's gravel.  Continue for 1/2 mile.

Turn left on 450 S.  It's paved again.

Turn right on 1380 E.  You'll pass Hills Baptist Church.  We're the 2nd house on the left after the church.  It's an old white farmhouse.  There is a circular driveway, a greenhouse, &amp; multiple outbuildings.

If for some reason you are traveling here from the north, it's easy to get here from SR 28.  Call for directions!
