Fill out the <a title="2012 CSA application" href="http://burkefarm.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/csa-2012-brochure.pdf">2012 CSA application</a> and send it to us either through old fashioned mail, or through email.  We'll let you know when you have been added for the 2012 season.

We drop off boxes in Noblesville and Fishers, at the Traders Point Green Market, and  in Carmel.  You can also pick up on our farm, if you live nearby.

Vacationers note:  We may be able to add an additional week to your season at the beginning or end, or add a chicken, if you need to miss a week.
