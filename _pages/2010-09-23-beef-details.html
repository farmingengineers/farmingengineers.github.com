<strong>How is your beef raised?</strong>

We've had our calves for about 18 months.  They have been fed grass, hay, and a salt/mineral lick.  We rotationally graze when the grass is growing fast.  We used apples to tame them- they were rather wild at first.  We believe that tame cows who are used to human contact live their lives with less stress.

<strong>How much meat will I take home from 1/2 beef?  Or 1/4?</strong>

This varies with the size of the animal, but on average, 1/4 is 100 lb and 1/2 is 200 lb.

<strong>How much freezer space is needed?</strong>

3.5 cubic feet for 1/4 beef,  7 for 1/2.  Some people get by with two refrigerator freezers for 1/4 beef, but a chest freezer is better (and keeps it colder).  For 1/2 beef, you definitely need a chest freezer.

<strong>Who is the processor?</strong>

We're using This Old Farm Meats &amp; Processing, in Colfax, IN.  They specialize in grass fed &amp; organic processing, have an experienced meat cutter, and are all-around great people.  They offer several options for picking up your finished meat, including the Trader's Point Green Market on Friday nights at Trader's Point Creamery.

<strong>Why do you charge by live weight, instead of by the # of cut &amp; wrapped meat?</strong>

This has to do with the legalities of selling meat.  Basically, we're selling you the live cow, and you're paying the processor for the rest.
<strong>
Will you sell cuts of meat individually?</strong>

We haven't decided for sure yet.  If we sell all our beef this year as quarter or half beef, then no.  Otherwise, we might get the proper licensing to sell individual cuts.

<strong>How does the pricing work?</strong>

Our aim is for your cut, wrapped meat to cost $4.00 or less per lb.  Here's how we have estimated this to work out for a 1000-lb, live weight cow.

For 1/2 beef:

Live weight: 1000 lb * 1/2 beef = 500 lb.
You pay us:  .90 per lb live weight = $450
Hanging weight of whole beef (after hide &amp; innards are removed, before aging) : 600 lb for whole beef.  So 300 lb for 1/2 beef.
You pay processor: .45 per lb hanging weight, portion of slaughter fee, plus possibly extra for patties, cubing, or other special cutting instructions.
Processing cost: .45 per lb * 300 lb + slaughter fee  = 175$
Actual yield of cut meat after aging = 60% of hanging weight = .6 * 300 lb = 180 lb

You get 180 lbs of meat
You paid 450 to us and 175 to processor:  625$
Cost per lb = About $3.50 per lb

Note that this is an estimate only- the live weight of our beef may vary from 800 lb up to 1400 # or so, and the yield of cut meat after aging also varies.  Also, you can pay extra processing fees and have jerky, brats, etc. made if you wish.  But this gives you a ballpark idea of what to expect.
