Here are a few beef recipes we enjoy.  We'll keep adding more throughout the winter.

<strong>Steak</strong>

Preheat a cast iron skillet in the oven at 500 F.

Rub both sides of steak with vegetable oil, salt &amp; pepper.

Remove skillet from oven &amp; place over high heat.  Sear steak for about 2 minutes per side.

Flip again &amp; place entire pan back in oven.  Cook for about 2 minutes per side, check temperature with a meat thermometer &amp; flip steak every 2 minutes.  Remove about 10 degrees prior to desired temperature.  Anything over 130 F and you may wish to consider adding a sauce to keep from drying out the meat.

Place steak on a rack over a plate &amp; cover with foil to let it "rest" for a few minutes before eating.

<strong>Huge Meatloaf</strong>

Chop 3 cups yellow onions.  Saute with 2 - 4 T olive oil and 1 tsp thyme until translucent.  Cool.

Combine 5 lb thawed ground beef, cooled onion mixture, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 1/3 c worcestershire sauce, 3 - 4 eggs, and 1.5 cups dry bread crumbs in a very large bowl.  Shape into a meatloaf in a big roasting pan.

Top with ketchup and bake at 300 F until at least 150 F inside, 60 to 90 minutes.   You can halve this recipe.  Makes fine meatloaf sandwich leftovers, serve with additional ketchup and horseradish.

I use this recipe for<a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/braised_beef_short_ribs/"> Short Ribs</a>, with a few changes:  beef stock instead of veal stock, and I cook it all in one day on the stove.  With grass-finished beef, you don't have enough extra fat to worry about scraping the fat off the top, and the fat you do have is good for you.  You may have to cook it longer to reduce the 6 cups of broth down to a reasonable degree.  Also, I like to use mushrooms as one of the vegetables- any kind of mushroom you like is a great addition.  Oxtail can be enjoyed in a similar fashion.
