Monday night:

Noblesville, Dillon Park, 5:45 to 6:15 PM.

I’ll be in a teal-colored Isuzu Trooper with Clinton County license plates.  Look for us in the parking lot by the water park, I’ll park as close to Kroger &amp; the football goal as I can.  Please call my cell phone number if you have trouble finding me!

Saturday:

We’re at the Carmel Farmers market from 8 AM until 11:30.  It’s best to pick up your share between 7:30 and 8 AM, before the market opens- your food is freshest then.    I found out mid-season last year that the CFM committee prefers not to host CSA pickups at their market, believing that it detracts from the “gathering place” atmosphere.  We’ll probably have to do the pickups somewhere else next year.

On-Farm pickup:

Your shares are being packed Monday.  Please come by on Tuesday to pick them up.

Next year:

Next year, we’d like to start having members host the pickup locations.  Requirements would be a covered, shaded area for the boxes (such as a garage) and a willingness to greet folks during an hour each week &amp; be sure the right person gets the right boxes.  Benefits to hosts would include the fun of meeting our delightful members, a 50% share discount, and, of course, home delivery of your share.  We’re looking to increase the size of our CSA continually over the next several years, and feel that this is the best way to bring food to a variety of neighborhoods.
