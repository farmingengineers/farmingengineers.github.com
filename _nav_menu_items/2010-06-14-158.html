We’re Mr. and Mrs. B, two engineers who started farming in 2008.  Mrs. B. has “retired” from her engineering career to farm and raise our child.  Mr. B. is still working as an engineer…. for now.  We’re renting our extra farmland to Farmer J, who is working with us to transition all of our acreage to organic within the next 5 years.  We have vegetables, chickens, and beef cows.
